Thanks to a careless technical specialist at Neev, selection sort and quick sort just stopped working.
As a fresher, debug the program with the help of browser developer tools using breakpoints and save the day by fixing the program.

The catch - also document your steps below.

Selection Sort
==============

## Steps

1. Step 1: I created the account in github
2. Step 2: I forked your files
3. step 3: then I cloned all the files to my local repository.
4. step 4: then i open the HTML file selection sort is not working.
5. step 5: I used launched the firebug the I put a break point on the third for loop then I observed 
           that  variable values then I got to know that there is some mistake in the max value that you have given
           then I changed the max value to i then changed the values of the for loop to i+1 then the algorithm works 
           perfectly.
6. step 6:then I commited all the changes.

QuickSort
=========

## Steps

1. Step 1:I opened the html file that I cloned in that quick sort is not working.
2. Step 2 : then I launched the firebug  then I put a break point near the first while loop then I found the values 
            of the variables are wrong then I come to know that some wrong with sending the values then I made the changes
              in the quicksort parameter to q-1 and also a.length-1 then I was able get the correct output.
3. step 3 :then I commited all the changes 
4. step 4: I pushed everything to remote repository then I sent a pull request.
