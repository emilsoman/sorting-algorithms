Thanks to a careless technical specialist at Neev, selection sort and quick sort just stopped working.
As a fresher, debug the program with the help of browser developer tools using breakpoints and save the day by fixing the program.

The catch - also document your steps below.

Selection Sort and QuickSort
============================

## Steps

1. Put some breakpoints in the quick sort and selection sort part of script.js
2. Analyse the values of variable that are used for array and array indices by hovering the mouse on those variables
3. As we know the basic logic of quick sort and selection sort I made some changes in conditional statements and assignment statements.
